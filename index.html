    <p id="pinkparagraph">Spinosaurus was one of the <span>largest</span> theropod dinosaurs, reaching lengths of up to 14–18 meters, even longer than
        T. rex.</p>
    <div class="left"><p>It had a crocodile-like snout filled with conical teeth, ideal for catching fish, and evidence suggests it was
        the first known semi-aquatic dinosaur, using its paddle-like tail and possibly webbed feet to hunt in rivers.
    </p></div>
    <div class="right"><p>Its most striking feature was the sail on its back, formed by elongated spines, which may have been used for
        display, thermoregulation, or species recognition. Unlike T. rex, which was a land-based apex predator,
        Spinosaurus thrived in watery habitats, making it a unique “river monster” of the Cretaceous.</p></div>
